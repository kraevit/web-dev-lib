/*
20-Declare-String-Variables.js
Previously we have used the code

var myName = "your name";

"your name" is called a string literal. It is a string because it is
a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

Instructions
Create two new string variables: myFirstName and myLastName and assign
them the values of your first and last name, respectively.

var myFirstName = "Krasimir";
var myLastName = "Kraev";

var myFullName = myFirstName + " " + myLastName;

console.log(myFullName);
